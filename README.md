# Fire Detecting Robo Car

This is my Fire Detecting RoboCar 
It is designed to detect fire ðŸ”¥ and automatically extinguish it with a waterðŸ’§ which is mounted on car.

Component that i have used
ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
1. Arduino Nano â€“ controlling all actions performed by a car.
2. 3 Flame Sensors â€“ Detect the presence and direction of fire.
3. Motor Driver (L298N) â€“ Controls the speed and direction of the DC motors .
4. Servo Motor â€“ it will sprinkle the water in all the direction where fire is. 
5. Water Pump â€“ Sprays water to extinguish the detected fire.
6. Relay Module â€“ Switches the water pump on and off safely.
7. 4 Li-ion Battery  â€“ Supplies power to the entire system.
8. Buck converter â€“ It is used to step down the voltage to give suppy to Arduino Nano.
